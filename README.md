# Customer-churn-SQL-analysis
This project analyzes customer churn behavior using SQL on the Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers).  The objective was to calculate churn rate, identify high-risk customer segments, and measure revenue impact using business-focused SQL queries.

## Objectives

--Calculate overall churn rate
--Compare tenure between churned and retained customers
--Identify churn patterns by contract type
--Analyze churn by payment method
--Measure monthly and annual revenue loss
--Identify high-risk customer segments

## Tools Used

MySQL, MySQL Workbench, SQL (Aggregation, CASE statements, GROUP BY)

Churned Customers: 1,869
Churn Rate: 26.54%

## Tenure Analysis
